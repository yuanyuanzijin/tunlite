> tunlite debuted publicly at **0.9.0**. Earlier `0.x` releases were a private
> prototype and are not part of this public history.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- `tunlite doctor` now reports **agent-skill freshness** — a `skill-fresh` check
  that warns when an installed copy of the bundled `ssh-tunnel` skill has drifted
  behind the one this version ships (the usual cause: `tunlite update` bumped the
  tool but the skill copy stayed behind). It compares content, not a version stamp,
  so a release that didn't touch the skill flags nothing. Refresh with
  `tunlite install skill`.

### Changed
- The bundled **`ssh-tunnel` agent skill** now tells the agent to **proactively ask
  whether a tunnel should start at login/boot** and, on a yes, run
  `tunlite install service`. Neither a bare `install` nor `enable` registers OS
  autostart, so a tunnel meant to be "always on" no longer silently vanishes after a
  reboot. The skill's install bootstrap (Step 0) was also rewritten around a single
  anchored install — every entry point (npm, curl, bundled copy) just seeds it.

### Docs
- README and the doc site now lead with tunlite's agent-first story ("for you and
  your Agent"), and a new plain-text guide at `tunlite.dev/skill.txt` lets an AI
  Agent install tunlite and register its skill by reading one link.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-19

### Changed (BREAKING)
- Renamed the tunnel-control verbs `up`/`down` → `enable`/`disable`. They always
  wrote the persistent `enabled` flag (a disabled tunnel stays down across daemon
  restarts and reboots), so the new names match the rest of the vocabulary
  (`--disabled` on `add`, the `disabled` state) and keep that persistent "intent"
  axis cleanly separate from the runtime axis (`daemon start`/`stop`, which run or
  stop the supervisor process now). The webhook `up`/`down` events and the monitor
  arrow-key navigation are unchanged. Migration: `tunlite up [name]` →
  `tunlite enable [name]`; `tunlite down [name]` → `tunlite disable [name]`.
- The action verbs `enable`/`disable`/`restart` now require an explicit target — a
  tunnel name, `--tag <label>`, or the literal `all` — instead of treating a bare verb
  as "all". Bare `tunlite enable` (which read like "enable the tool" and silently
  flipped every tunnel) is now a usage error (exit 2) pointing you to a target. `all`
  is a reserved tunnel name. The read-only views `status`/`list`/`monitor` still
  default to all. Migration: `tunlite enable` (no args) → `tunlite enable all`.
- Forwards are now defined with ssh-native flags `-L`/`-R`/`-D` (repeatable),
  shared by `add`, `set`, and `run`. `add` reshaped:
  `tunlite add <name> --to user@host -L 8080:localhost:80 -D 1080`.
  Migration: `add local <name> --remote 80 --local 8080` → `add <name> -L 8080:localhost:80`;
  `add remote <name> --local 3000 --remote 9000` → `add <name> -R 9000:localhost:3000`;
  `add dynamic <name> --local 1080` → `add <name> -D 1080`.
- `install` is now a single guided entry point. Bare `tunlite install` anchors the
  runtime and (in a terminal) asks whether to add autostart / shell completion /
  the agent skill; `tunlite install -y` says yes to all; with no `-y` and no
  terminal it only anchors. The per-step opt-in/opt-out flags
  (`--service`/`--skill <dir>`/`--completion` and `--no-*`) and their env twins
  (`TUNLITE_SERVICE`/`TUNLITE_SKILL`/`TUNLITE_COMPLETION`) are gone — to set up one
  piece on its own, use the positional `install service|skill|completion`. Passing a
  removed flag now exits 2 with guidance.
- `export` now prints only your tunnels (`{ version, tunnels }`) — the exact shape
  `import` reads — instead of the whole config. It previously also dumped the
  `settings` block, but `import` only ever merges tunnels and never reads settings,
  so the settings were redundant; worse, the webhook url in them was redacted to a
  display form (`https://host/…`), so an `export`→`import` round-trip looked lossless
  while silently carrying a corrupted, unusable url. Settings (backoff/keepalive
  tuning, the webhook url + token) are machine-local and stay out of the portable
  export. To see them, read `config.json` (path shown by `tunlite doctor`).

### Added
- `tunlite run` — a daemon-less, foreground, supervised tunnel for container /
  systemd entrypoints (`--json` NDJSON state, `--exit-on-failure`).
- `set <name> -L/-R/-D …` replaces a tunnel's whole forward set.
- "Did you mean": a mistyped command or subcommand now suggests the nearest one
  (`tunlite stauts` → "did you mean `status`?"), and the retired `up`/`down` (plus
  `start`/`stop`) point at `enable`/`disable`. Covers the top-level commands and the
  `daemon`/`webhook`/`install`/`uninstall` subverbs.
- `all` as an explicit target for `enable`/`disable`/`restart` (e.g.
  `tunlite enable all`) — every tunnel, stated rather than implied.
- The route column (and the `add`/`set` echo) now points its arrow at the far
  side: a local forward reads `:8080 → :80` and a remote forward `:9000 ← :3000`.
  Endpoints keep ssh-flag order; the arrow direction alone distinguishes local
  from remote at a glance.

### Removed (BREAKING)
- The `forward list|add|rm` command group. Use `set <name> -L/-R/-D …` to redefine
  a tunnel's forwards.

### Fixed
- `install --skill` no longer fails right after a global npm install. The skill
  step resolved its source relative to the running copy, but `install` runs it
  after `anchor()`'s legacy cleanup removes that copy (the npm-global dir), so it
  reported `skill source not found` and skipped the agent skill. It now falls
  back to the freshly anchored `libDir` copy recorded in the install manifest.
- `--json` now applies to error paths too. Usage and not-found errors previously
  printed plain text to stderr even under `--json`; they now emit
  `{ "error": …, "code": N }` on stdout (exit code unchanged). Covers `add`,
  `set`, `rm`, `rename`, `status`, `run`, `webhook`, `import`, unknown commands,
  and more. Human (non-`--json`) output is unchanged.
- `status --json` tunnel objects now carry `lastExitCode` in every state. It was
  present only for live tunnels (from the supervisor) and missing for
  idle/stopped/`daemon-stopped` ones, so an agent's parsed schema shifted with
  tunnel state; the key is now always present.
- Doc site: the `blocked` state (endpoint conflict) is now listed in the
  documented state values, matching the CLI and `SKILL.md`.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **`tunlite update` no longer fails with a bogus `could not fetch … (need curl
  or wget)` once the repository archive grows past ~1 MB.** The fetcher captured
  the tarball into `spawnSync`'s 1 MB-default stdout buffer, so a larger archive
  overflowed it (`ENOBUFS`, the fetcher killed with `SIGTERM`) and surfaced as a
  missing-tool error even though curl/wget were installed and the download was
  reachable. It now downloads to a file (no in-memory buffer, any size) and the
  error message distinguishes a genuinely absent tool from a failed download,
  including the fetcher's own stderr.
  - Already on 0.9.4 or earlier? That broken `update` can't pull this fix itself —
    re-install once with `npx tunlite@latest install`; subsequent `tunlite update`
    runs then work normally.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **`logs <name>` now exits not-found (`3`) for an unknown tunnel** instead of
  silently tailing an empty channel and exiting `0` — it was the only
  name-taking command that didn't honor the not-found contract, so an agent
  probing `tunlite logs typo --json` read it as "succeeded, no logs". A bare
  `logs` with no name still tails the daemon's own log.
- **`add` refuses a duplicate name (exit `2`) instead of silently overwriting.**
  It used to upsert, so re-adding an existing name replaced the prior definition
  and exited `0` — quiet data loss. Use `set <name> …` to change a tunnel in place
  or `rm <name>` first. An invalid tunnel name is now a usage error (`2`) too,
  rather than bubbling up as a generic error (`1`).
- **`list` / `status` with a `--tag` that matches nothing now exit not-found (`3`)**,
  matching `up`/`down`/`restart` and the documented tag contract. `list` returned
  `0` and `status` returned `0` (daemon up) or even `5` (daemon down); the tag is
  now checked against config up front, so the answer is a consistent `3` either way.
  (`monitor` is a live dashboard, so it shows an empty view rather than exiting.)
- **Anchored-install detection is now symlink-tolerant.** `isAnchored()` compared
  the manifest's literal `libDir` against the realpath-resolved running directory,
  so when the install dir was reached through a symlink — `/home` → `/var/home` on
  Fedora Silverblue/CoreOS/openSUSE MicroOS, or `/tmp` → `/private/tmp` on macOS —
  a correct install reported un-anchored forever: the "run `tunlite install`" nudge
  never cleared and `tunlite update` refused to self-update. It now compares
  canonical paths on both sides.
- **`status <name> --json` now exits not-found (`3`) for an unknown tunnel**,
  matching the human path. It returned the full snapshot with an empty
  `tunnels[]` and exit `0`, so an agent couldn't tell "doesn't exist" from
  "exists" by exit code; it now emits `{error, code: 3}` and exits `3`.
- **`<command> --help` / `-h` now prints help and exits `0` for every command**,
  as the README promises. Previously only the bare command position honored it;
  placed after a verb (`tunlite status --help`) it fell through and was rejected
  as an unknown option — and `tunlite export --help` ignored the flag and dumped
  the config. `-h`/`--help` are not real flags on any command, so they are now
  intercepted globally.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **`uninstall` now confirms before tearing everything down**, and warns when
  tunnels are currently up (counted from the daemon), so you can't wipe a live
  setup by reflex. `--force` skips the prompt; `--json` and non-interactive runs
  proceed unprompted as before.

### Changed
- **`tunlite update` upgrades to the latest published *release tag*, not the
  branch tip.** It resolves the newest `vX.Y.Z` tag and re-anchors that, so a
  self-update can only ever land on a real released version (which, by release
  discipline, is also on npm) — the installed version can no longer drift onto an
  unreleased commit, and `npm`'s view can't diverge from what's actually running.
- **`update` refuses a non-anchored install with the right per-channel guidance:**
  a git checkout → `git pull`; an `npm i -g` install → `npm i -g tunlite@latest`
  (so that channel's version metadata stays authoritative); anything else → re-run
  `npx tunlite install`.

### Docs
- Slimmed the README (EN/ZH) to a concise landing that points to the documentation
  site for the deep reference; trimmed this changelog to the public era (0.9.0+);
  de-duplicated the quickstart — `install service` is optional autostart that also
  brings tunnels up, so it no longer reads as a step after `up`.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **Too-old Node now fails fast with a clear message instead of a cryptic
  crash.** Running under Node < 18 (e.g. an old `nvm` default) let `install`
  print success and then throw a `SyntaxError` from a module using newer syntax,
  with no hint why. The entry point now checks the Node version first — before
  requiring any modern module — and exits with `tunlite requires Node.js >= 18 …`
  plus the `nvm install 18` fix. The guard lives in a small ES5-only
  `src/node-check.js` so it parses on any runtime.
- **`curl … | sh` now prompts instead of silently skipping setup.** Piped into a
  shell the installer's stdin carries the script, so the interactive service /
  skill / completion questions were skipped — nothing got registered and the
  daemon never started, making it look like `install` hadn't run. `confirm()`
  now reads the answer from the controlling terminal (`/dev/tty`) when stdin is
  piped, so the one-liner asks the same y/N questions as a direct run (pre-answer
  with `--service` / `--no-skill` / … to stay non-interactive). Both bootstraps
  also verify Node ≥ 18 up front. On Windows (no `/dev/tty`) the bootstrap
  registers autostart by default; the skill and completion stay opt-in.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **`install` confirmation prompts were invisible on a real terminal.** The
  prompt was written separately and then readline opened with an empty query;
  in terminal mode readline's line refresh erased the just-written text, leaving
  a blank line where the question should be (you had to answer blind). The
  prompt is now rendered by readline itself, so it always shows.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-16

First public release.

### Added
- **ProxyJump / bastion support.** `--jump [user@]host[:port][,...]` on `add`,
  `check`, and `setup-key` (and a per-tunnel `jump` field) makes tunnels through a
  jump host first-class, instead of needing raw `--ssh-opt`.
- **Multiple forwards per tunnel.** `tunlite forward list|add|rm <tunnel>` manages
  several `-L`/`-R`/`-D` forwards carried over a single ssh connection.
- **Edit existing tunnels.** `tunlite set <name> [--to …] [-i key] [--jump …]
  [--ssh-opt …] [--auto-key|--no-auto-key]` changes a tunnel's connection settings
  in place (forwards stay managed by `forward`).
- **Tags / groups.** Label tunnels with `--tag <label>` (repeatable) on `add`, edit
  with `set --tag` / `set --no-tags`, then act on a whole group: `up`/`down`/
  `restart`/`status`/`list`/`monitor` accept `--tag <label>` to select every tunnel
  carrying it (multiple `--tag` = union). A name and `--tag` are mutually exclusive.
  Tags are metadata only and never change the ssh command; the `tags` array shows up
  in `list --json` / `status --json`.

### Fixed
- The passwordless probe behind `check` / `up` / `doctor` now applies the tunnel's
  jump hosts and ssh options, so a jump-only host is no longer misreported as not
  passwordless.
- **Reconnect backoff** now resets only after a connection has been sustained for
  `resetAfterMs` (60s), not the instant it reaches "connected". A tunnel that keeps
  dropping right after connecting backs off as intended instead of reconnecting at
  the base delay indefinitely.
- **No more double daemon.** A racing second `up` no longer unlinks a live
  daemon's control socket; a stale socket is removed only after probing that no
  daemon answers. `stop()` also reliably escalates to SIGKILL when an ssh child
  ignores SIGTERM, instead of leaving it wedged.
- **`logs` no longer truncates** — a non-follow `logs -n <N>` waits for the daemon's
  real end-of-stream instead of a fixed 200 ms window, so a large `-N` returns every
  line. An interrupted `install` also self-heals its runtime swap (restores the
  previous copy) rather than leaving no runtime behind.

### Security
- **ssh argument injection closed.** A host or jump hop beginning with `-` is
  rejected on config load, and a `--` terminator precedes the destination, so a
  crafted target can no longer be read by ssh as an option (e.g. `-oProxyCommand=…`).
- **Daemon control socket locked to the owner** — its directory is created `0700`
  and the socket `0600` on Unix, so other local users can't drive the daemon on the
  `~/.tunlite` fallback (used when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset, e.g. on macOS).
- **Webhook URLs are redacted** in all CLI output, `--json`, daemon logs, and
  `export` (the Slack/WeCom token rides in the URL); the daemon refuses a
  non-`http(s)` webhook URL.
- **Self-update fetches over `https` or `file` only** — an `http` downgrade or a
  hostile mirror can no longer feed arbitrary code into the updater.
- **Webhook responses are capped at 8 KB** so a hostile or misbehaving endpoint
  can't stream unbounded data into the daemon process.
- **`setup-key` validates the public key** — it refuses a key containing a newline
  or a single quote before building the remote command, closing a shell-injection
  path through a crafted key comment.
